    "content": "I am very happy to have this new update of PrimusC2 released. I have hit some pretty big milestones with the project and done some cool stuff.What‚Äôs new:  File Operations          cd      ls¬†      pwd        Execute .NET Assembly in memory (HYPE)  Revamp of data transfer between server and implant¬†  Added more exception handling (not bulletproof yet)  Changed how the implant handles commands (no more of accidentally firing of a command)  Quality of life stuff          Command History¬†      Autocomplete Commands¬†        Removed persistence functionality (will implement another version in the future)Im going to elaborate on some of the changes in the coming sections.¬†Execute .NET Assembly¬†This one is huge for me, i wanted from the start to include some more advanced functionality in the C2, to elevate it from being an Advanced Reverse Shell Handler. I have now successfully implemented the execution of .NET assemblies in memory.¬†Here is a short demo of the new functionality in action üòé¬†The functionality for execute assembly has been tested with a couple of popular offensive .NET tools, such as Rubeus, SharpWMI, Seatbelt and so on. The current state of the functionality is still quite unpredictable and can do weird stuff sometimes (still working on that). Large output from tools, seems to break it, and I haven‚Äôt found a proper solution for that yet. However, I am still very pleased with the progress I have made so far.File OperationsPrimusC2 now has some proper directory operations on the machine; it does not rely on PowerShell anymore to do: ls, cd and pwd, this makes it easier to traverse the filesystem and see what goodies that are hidden on the desktop üëÄHere you can see it action:Quality of life and command handlingIve made some small (but nice) quality of life improvements. Ive added command history (Arrow Up/Down) to make it more dynamic, and I have added autocompletion for the native commands in PrimusC2. Furthermore, I have changed the way commands are handled on the implant side. Preivoulsy, when a command was executed from the server side, the implant would try and execute that as a powershell command directly. Now the implant only has unmanaged powershell and can execute commands with Windows CMD as well, but you need to specify either pwsh or shell :)¬†ConclusionMy plan is to keep developing on this when I have the time to make more cool features, but also more stable and less prone to crap out if something goes wrong or the operator mistypes anything. It has turned out that using TCP as a C2 channel can be quite challenging, and sometimes it lives its own life. In the future, I am going to explore HTTP as a C2 channel to perhaps bring more stability to the C2.Big shoutout to all the other nim projects out there, they helped me great deal while working on this update!This is it for now. I hope that you will enjoy the update, and I would love to hear your feedback or answer any questions that you might have.Thanks for reading, and have an excellent day.¬†¬†"

    "content": "I‚Äôm very pleased to announce that I passed the Certified Red Team Professional(CRTP), from Altered Security. It was quite an enjoyable experience, appreciating not only the opportunity to reinforce my existing knowledge but also the newly gained skills.Throughout this post, I will go through my thoughts about the learning material, the exam experience, and the final conclusion about the certificate itself.The Training Material and LabThe format of the learning material is nothing fancy. You will receive a zip file containing all the files, knowledge, etc. that you need in order to pass the exam. No other resources are required (looking at you, Offsec üëÄ..)If you pay good attention to the videos and complete the lab fully, you should be good to go‚Ä¶.However, there are some prerequisites, imo, in order for this to apply to you:¬†      TAKE notes, and do it thoroughly; this means writing down commands, tool syntaxes, short descriptions of topics, and so on. Finally, this is the deciding factor in whether you will succeed or fail.        Think basic, and rely on your GOOD notes.¬†        Understand enumeration in Active Directory using manual tools like PowerView. But learn to use Bloodhound, this will give you a way better overview and save you a lot of time in the end.  FormatRegarding the format of the learning material, as of right now, the videos that are up-to-date are in the format of four 2-3 hours recordings from the Live bootcamps that they offer. This makes it very hard to track your own progress and can be frustrating at times because the instructor will interact with the live audience (kind of felt like a time waste for me). I am much in favor of the model that TCM offers, with an online platform that has short and to-the-point videos with a progress bar.ContentEven though I disliked the format, I really liked the content and the knowledge presented in the course. It covers everything from simple enumeration in Active Directory to persistence, etc. The instructor does a good job of presenting the content, and it‚Äôs up-to-date. It‚Äôs not run this tool and see the MAGIC output; he actually goes into explaining the concepts and technologies behind the attacks. Thumbs up for that, üëçLab timeThe lab is all-round very well built; it‚Äôs reasonable stable, a BUNCH of attacks are covered, and there is a great lab manual to support your learning (I do encourage to try and complete as much of the lab as possible without using the lab manual). I opted for 30 days of lab time, which was plenty of time for me, but this might be different, if you come into this certification with very little knowledge of Active Directory. If you are really new to AD pentesting, I would recommend going with 60 days to ensure that you have tried all the attacks at least once or twice.The exam and reportingI can‚Äôt say much about the exam experience without violating any NDAs. But the exam itself was in a very stable environment, and the customer support was quick and awesome. You have 24 hours to complete the given exam lab and then 48 hours to complete a written report covering your findings, mitigations, etc. I used around 6 hours to complete the lab (including raw notes and screenshots along the way). For the report, I opted to relax a bit, so I spent around 12 hours on that.I used pwndoc to write my report. I use this tool for all my certifications, as it lets me create a library of findings and custom sections that I can use for the generic findings I discover. It‚Äôs only worth it to use pwndoc, if you keep on building your library of findings, since the tool can‚Äôt generate anything automated for you.ConclusionThis certification is really good if you are just getting started in pentesting Active Directory, a blue teamer who wants to understand AD attacks better, or just a pentester looking to reafirm your skills or perhaps gain a few new ones. I would rate the exam level at easy/medium depending on your expereince level, and i would reccommned to everyone considering taking the certifications just to do it. Buy it, set an exam date for yourself and go nuts in the lab.Good luck and have fun!¬†¬†"
